My CV includes links to specific parts of my linkedin profile, for prospective employers who are interested in more details.
However the linkedin "hack" to link to anchors doesn't work anymore so I had to adopt a DIY approach :) (giving up was not an option)
This page is a copy of my linkedin profile, with anchors to which some sections of my CV link. 
The links in the CV are tracked (anonymously, only the number of clicks is tracked) in order to find out what employers are most interested to know more about.
Do you have a guess ?
